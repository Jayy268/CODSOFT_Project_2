# Sales Prediction Model
A machine learning project designed to predict sales based on the amount spent on different forms of advertising, such as TV, radio, and newspaper ads. The model aims to help businesses optimize their advertising budgets for maximum returns.
# Project Description
This project utilized a Random Forest Regressor that uses advertising expenditure as input to predict sales. By analyzing historical advertising data, the model identifies relationships between spending on TV, radio, and newspaper ads and their impact on sales. The model was trained using a free dataset from Kaggle
